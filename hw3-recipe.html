        <h1>Homemade Cherry Pie</h1>
        <hr/>

        <p><i>This recipe is better than ever. My <b>homemade cherry pie</b> is perfectly sliceable with a thick almond-hinted cherry pie filling and a golden brown buttery flaky<b><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/">pie crust</a></b>. The ingredients are exactly the same as when I originally published the recipe in 2017, but quartering <b>*some*</b> of the cherries instead of just halving and reducing some juices on the stovetop both guarantee that the pie filling will set up perfectly. As always, wait for the pie to cool completely before slicing, which is another non-negotiable that helps avoid a soupy pie filling. </i> </p>

        <p><i>No store-bought pie filling or pie crust because today we’re making cherry pie completely from scratch. Does making homemade pie intimidate you? I promise this dessert specialty is nothing to fear and that’s exactly why I’m sharing my recipe with you. Out of all pie flavors, cherry pie is where most bakers depend on canned filling, but I’m going to teach you how to make the most of fresh cherries and a delicious crust.</i></p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b> Prepare the cherry filling</b> 
                <br/>
                <small>Place cherries in medium saucepan and place over heat. Cover. After the cherries lose considerable juice, which may take a few minutes, remove from heat. In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cornstarch together. Pour this mixture into the hot cherries and mix well. Add the almond extract, if desired, and mix. Return the mixture to the stove and cook over low heat until thickened, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and let cool. If the filling is too thick, add a little water, too thin, add a little more cornstarch.</small>

            <li>
                <b>Turn on your over</b>
                <br/>
                <small>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</small>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Prepare the dough</b>
                <br/>
                <small>Use your favorite pie dough recipe. Prepare your crust. Divide in half. Roll out each piece large enough to fit into an 8 to 9-inch pan. Pour cooled cherry mixture into the crust. Dot with butter. Moisten edge of bottom crust. Place top crust on and flute the edge of the pie. Make a slit in the middle of the crust for steam to escape. Sprinkle with sugar.</small>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Bake it</b>
                <br/>
                <small>Bake for about 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool.</small>
